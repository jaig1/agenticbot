## Query Guidelines (BigQuery Specific):

### BigQuery SQL Best Practices:
- Use `SELECT *` sparingly in production queries
- Always use `LIMIT` for exploratory queries
- Use `DATE()` functions for date comparisons
- Use `IFNULL()` or `COALESCE()` for null handling
- Use `ARRAY_AGG()` for aggregating arrays
- Use standard SQL `COUNT(*)`, `SUM()`, `AVG()` functions

### Query Patterns from Knowledge Graph:

### Policy Lifecycle Rules:
- **Expiring Soon**: Policy expiring within the next 30 days
  - Logic: `end_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

- **New Policy**: Policy issued in the last 30 days
  - Logic: `start_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

### Policy Status Rules:
- **Active Policy**: Policy currently in force with valid dates and active status
  - Logic: `status = 'Active' AND CURRENT_DATE() BETWEEN start_date AND end_date`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

- **Expired Policy**: Policy that has passed its end date
  - Logic: `status = 'Expired' OR end_date < CURRENT_DATE()`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

### Premium Segmentation Rules:
- **Premium Segment - Budget**: Budget tier policies under $2,000
  - Logic: `premium <= 2000`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

- **Premium Segment - Premium**: Premium tier policies above $5,000
  - Logic: `premium > 5000`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

- **Premium Segment - Standard**: Standard tier policies $2,000-$5,000
  - Logic: `premium BETWEEN 2000 AND 5000`
  - Applies to: insurance_policies

### Composite Business Rules:
- **Retention Risk** (customer_retention): Customer with expiring policies and recent claims
  - Complex Logic: ```sql
customer_id IN (
                    SELECT DISTINCT p.customer_id
                    FROM insurance_policies p
                    JOIN insurance_claims c ON p.policy_id = c.policy_id
                    WHERE p.policy_end_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
                    AND c.claim_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
                )
  ```

- **Profitable Customer** (profitability): Customer with high premiums and low claims
  - Complex Logic: ```sql
customer_id IN (
                    SELECT p.customer_id
                    FROM insurance_policies p
                    LEFT JOIN insurance_claims c ON p.policy_id = c.policy_id
                    GROUP BY p.customer_id
                    HAVING SUM(p.premium) > IFNULL(SUM(c.claim_amount), 0) * 2
                )
  ```

- **High Risk Customer** (risk_assessment): Customer with multiple recent high-value claims
  - Complex Logic: ```sql
customer_id IN (
                    SELECT p.customer_id
                    FROM insurance_policies p
                    JOIN insurance_claims c ON p.policy_id = c.policy_id
                    WHERE c.claim_amount > 10000
                    AND c.claim_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 365 DAY)
                    GROUP BY p.customer_id
                    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
                )
  ```

## BigQuery Execution Guidelines:

### 1. Query Performance:
- **Partitioning**: Use `WHERE` clauses on partitioned columns when available
- **Clustering**: Take advantage of clustered columns for filtering
- **SELECT Optimization**: Avoid `SELECT *` in production queries
- **LIMIT Usage**: Always use `LIMIT` for exploratory analysis

### 2. BigQuery-Specific Syntax:
- **Date Functions**: Use `DATE()`, `DATETIME()`, `TIMESTAMP()` functions
- **String Functions**: Use `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTR()`, `REGEXP_CONTAINS()`
- **Array Functions**: Use `ARRAY_AGG()`, `UNNEST()` for array operations
- **Window Functions**: Use `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`

### 3. Data Types and Casting:
- **Casting**: Use `CAST(column AS TYPE)` or `SAFE_CAST()` for safe casting
- **Null Handling**: Use `IFNULL()`, `COALESCE()`, `NULLIF()`
- **Date Arithmetic**: Use `DATE_ADD()`, `DATE_SUB()`, `DATE_DIFF()`

### 4. Privacy and Security:
- **PII Columns**: Be cautious with columns marked as PII (ðŸ”’)
- **Access Controls**: Respect sensitivity levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- **Data Masking**: Consider using `EXCEPT()` to exclude sensitive columns

### 5. Default Query Behavior:
- **Row Limits**: Add `LIMIT 100` for exploratory queries unless specified
- **Ordering**: Use `ORDER BY` for consistent results
- **Aggregations**: Group by non-aggregate columns in SELECT

### 6. Insurance Domain Context:
- **Customer Analysis**: Join customers with policies for portfolio analysis
- **Claims Analysis**: Join policies with claims for loss analysis
- **Agent Performance**: Join agents with policies for sales metrics
- **Risk Assessment**: Use business rules for risk categorization
