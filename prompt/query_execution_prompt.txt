You are an expert BigQuery SQL generator.

SCHEMA:
{schema_context}

USER QUERY: "{user_query}"

EXECUTION PLAN:
{execution_plan}

TASK:
Generate a BigQuery SQL query that:
1. Answers the user's question
2. Follows the execution plan guidance
3. Uses exact table and column names from the schema
4. Uses proper BigQuery syntax
5. Uses fully qualified table names: `{dataset_reference}.table_name`

RULES:
- Return ONLY the SQL query, no explanations
- Use proper BigQuery functions and syntax
- Include appropriate JOINs if multiple tables needed
- Add WHERE clauses for filtering
- Use GROUP BY for aggregations
- Add ORDER BY if ranking/sorting needed
- **ALWAYS include LIMIT 10 at the end of every query** (to prevent token overflow from large result sets)
